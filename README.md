How to Navigate Through the Ruby Conference Tour Project

Once you've accessed the Tour homepage, click "Registration" on the navbar.  This will bring up the form to create a new customer in the database.  Enter a first name, last name, and email into the form and click the "Create Customer" button.  This takes you to the show page and shows the information you entered.  From here, you can edit the customer information or go back to the existing customers page.  At this point, you can go to the customer's show page, edit, or delete the information.  There is a link back to the home page at the bottom.
